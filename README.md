#Conditionals Stretch Lab

In the `lab.rb` file, create an alarm clock using army time (0-24). It should remind you to do several things throughout the day, depending on the time. For example - wake up, eat lunch, go for a run, brush teeth, go to bed.    
Add as much functionality as you see fit.   
Be creative!
